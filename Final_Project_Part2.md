## *Make caring for the environment cool…to the coolest people…in the coolest places*

Growing up, I’ve also has a particular curiosity in the beautiful Earth and all of her inhabitants. I used to cry when I would see pictures of ocean shores filled with plastic or duckling feathers smothered with the remnants of oil spills. As I got older, I became more vocal about my interests. I would interact with my friends, many of whom were people of color, and they would think I was a nerd for picking up a piece of litter or asking them to recycle their plastic bottle. I noticed that when I talked to many of my white counterparts, I didn’t typically receive the same negative reaction. Why? I decided to do a little digging myself and found the concept of environmental justice.

# What is environmental justice?

The intersection of environmentalism + social justice

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, it's "Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies." 
[EPA](https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice) 

Since environmental (in)justice is such a complex topic that takes many forms with multiple factors interplaying, I thought an infographic would be a comprehensive way to show a variety of information.

- Health:
Due to long-standing inequalities in living, working, health, and social conditions, minorities in the U.S. are 4-5 times more likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19 than the White population

- Air: 
People of color make up 56% of the population living in neighborhoods with toxic emission facilities, compared to 30% elsewhere.

- Food:
Food prices are higher, and quality is lower in high poverty areas, causing food insecurity. On overage, the U.S. household spends 14% of income on food; low-income families spend over 30%.

- Climate Change: 
Low-income communities have a higher likelihood of exposure to climate change threats (e.g., flooding, storms, and droughts) due to inadequate housing and infrastructure.

- Energy: 
Low-income households spend 3x as much of their income on energy than higher-income households, despite consuming less energy,

- Land: 
Availability of cheap land in disadvantaged urban centers has led to gentrification, an increase in property values that often makes the area unaffordable to existing (generally lower income) residents. This causes displacement in addition to as social, economic, and cultural stress.

# So how can you identify what environmental (in)justice looks like in your neighborhood?

I created a simple chart to visualize some of the leading types of environmental injustices based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency to highlight to provide contrast as to what EJ does NOT look like. I decided not to use numerical values so that my audience can just see them up front with minimal thought.

Indicators you may be living in an injustice area:


Change inaccessible, change formatting so that no label overlap
Helpful because she didn’t know exactly what these look like

# Case Study: Allegheny County and Air Pollution

Pittsburgh is known as the “Steel City” for a reason…
Photos of steel
Quick history on steel industry in Pittsburgh

But to who’s detriment?
Many of those same neighborhoods that were once the source of the city’s booming economy are now left abandoned, with residents experiencing health issues and lower qualities of life due to the impact of the steel factories in the area.

With Allegheny County alone…

•	11.7 live under the poverty line
•	Less than 1 are Hispanic and 10 are non-Hispanic
[Source](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showInfoByLocationExt?&FIPS=42003)

Pittsburgh has yet again been ranked as one of the worst places for air pollution among US cities, coming in at 8th place
[Source](https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/report-pittsburgh-ranked-8th-worst-for-air-pollution-among-us-cities/Content?oid=17179037)

Within the city:
Poor, minority neighborhoods see higher rates of deaths from air pollution
[Source](https://www.ehn.org/environmental-injustice-pittsburgh-air-pollution-2646169635.html)

I created a chart highlighting the top 5 areas with the highest need within Allegheny County using the following community-identified metrics of community health:

• Median Household Income (MHINC)
• Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM)
• Particulate Matter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5) 
• Percent of the population identified as a racial minority
• Proximity to Greenspace 
• Educational Attainment
• Miles of Railroad Track Coverage 
• Housing Vacancy

Too much text- largest to smallest- define environmental needs and EJ index scores

## Call to Action

1)	Links for additional information:

[Source](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Health_Department/Resources/Data_and_Reporting/Chronic_Disease_Epidemiology/HEB-ENV.pdf)

2)	Ways to implement environmentally sustainable behaviors in everyday life:
- Recycle plastic bottles
- Reuse plastic bags
- Turn off lights when not in use
- Consume less meat
- Only take what you can eat
- Turn off the running water while brushing your teeth
- Grow and harvest your own fresh produce in a local garden
- EDUCATE YOURSELF
[Source](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/15-easy-ways-to-become-environmentally-friendly.php)


3)	Call out your friends
So, if your friend throws a piece of garbage on the ground, let him know that that is SO uncool


## User Research and Interviews

- Target Audience: Individuals of color living in marginalized areas within Pittsburgh 
- Approach to identifying representative individuals: I interview people of color, but to make the sample more representative I chose participants who
 1) come from diverse cultural/ethnic backgrounds and
 2) live in either impoverished and non-impoverished areas within Pittsburgh. 

- Interview Findings:							

# *Questions*

1) What do you think the purpose of this dataviz is for?

2) Were you aware of this information previously?

3) If I were to create a presentation from this data, to whom do you think it would be intended for?

4) Is there anything that’s surprising/ difficult to understand in either the info or the data visualizations?

5) What would you change? 

6) What do you think would be an effective way for me to incite curiosity in this topic?

# *Main Findings*	

1) Overall, all the respondents understood the gist of my data visualizations, but at time times they relied on the times to understand each graph’s purpose. 

2) Most of my respondents know of EJ, but they weren’t aware it could come in certain forms such as energy poverty or gentrification. One of my interviews pointed out that the areas highlighted in my bar chart were “Mon Valley” towns located alongside the Monongahela River.

3) Two respondents said the intended audience is the general public. One respondent said it’s geared to Mayor Peduto or other Pittsburgh residents.

4) Two of the interviewees weren’t sure how to define energy poverty. They also mentioned that because they live in Pittsburgh, they’re familiar with the areas highlighted in my bar chart, but if they hadn’t lived in Pittsburgh, they would know that those areas are majority poor communities of color.

5) Respondents mentioned that the infographic was a bit difficult to read, so they would make the font larger.
Another respondent said that the bars on the chart looked as if they were the same lengths, so perhaps they would change the color of each bar to highlight the differences. All interviews felt that the format of the pie chart should be changed so that the labels are fitting on each slice without overlap.

6) Respondents mentioned that with this sort of topic, it’s so easy for people to brush off as if environmental injustice only happens in other places. One respondent suggested that if I’m trying increase curiosity in my target audience, I need to discuss what’s happening in neighborhoods they’re familiar with or ask them where their parents/grandparents live and discuss that.

# *Future Changes*

1) I will be more deliberate about my titles and labels, as well as the information being displayed. I also think the visualizations may be easier to understand with some narrative with some context, but I do need to be more strategic about my data.

2) I should define less commonly known terms, being mindful to avoid jargon. In general, I need to proofread multiple times for typos and minor errors.

3) Though I do want everyone to know this information, I think I should reframe my narrative to be more targeted toward marginalized communities in Pittsburgh.

4) I know that my data visualizations are a work in progress. In revising my graphs using some of the suggestions as to what respondents would change, I’m hoping that I can create more effective, clear, and visually appealing graphs. 

5) Pie Chart- if I’m not going to use specific proportions just use icons rather than a pie chart
Infographic- use more impactful headers to call out facts like “food deserts” or “gentrification” (use iconography)
Bar chart- use color and make vertical
Map of Allegheny County- in additional to highlighting areas, provide racial demographics for each as well 

6) I will add a more personal appeal to the story and presentation. I chose the topic because it is personal to me, but I may have lost sight of this note when creating my project. Also, I will provide more actionable ways contribute to EJ while simultaneously encouraging sustainable behaviors.
