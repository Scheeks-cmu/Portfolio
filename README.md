# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About Me
Hello! My name is Scout Cheeks (she/her) and I'm a first year graduate student in the Telling Stories with Data course. I'm in the Public Policy & Management program-- Washington, D.C. track through the Heinz College of Information Systems & Public Policy. I was named after the novel *To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee. I love to sing, dance, EAT, play sports, love on animals, and spend time with family. Upon graduation, I would love to work in the foreign policy field, where I am able to make change on a global and local scale.

# What I Hope to Learn
I hope that I am able to thoroughly grasp the main concepts of data visualization. It is interesting to compare/contrast charts and grasps, but by the end of the course I want to be able to identify the theoretical frameworks to compose or improve a data visual. Furthermore, I want to be able to readily translate the skills learned throughout this course into meaningful work in the policy field.
