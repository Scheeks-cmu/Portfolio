# "Environmental Injustices in Marginalized Communities"

## Outline

I am interested in showing the disparities of social and environmental injustices occurring within their marginalized communities. I intend to use this project to start a nonprofit organization that educates these communities on the inequities occurring within their neighborhood, improves sustainability and development in marginalized areas, and encourages practices that promote both social justice and environmentalism.


## Initial Sketches


The first sketch is a map of Allegheny County. I think it would be useful to offer a data visualization on which areas within the city of Pittsburgh encounter the highest rates of negative environmental effects, since my ultimate goal is to start a nonprofit in that area.

The second sketch is a simple pie chart that illustrates various categories of environmental justice. Straight forward and to the point.

The third sketch is an infographic. I’m still grappling with how I want to present the data on environmental justice inequities and considering that the topic has so many intersectional factors; so I think an infographic would be a comprehensive way to present a lot of substantive information at once.

## Data

I will use the 2020 EJ (environmental justice) index provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). I chose to use this dataset since the EPA is a federal agency implemented under E.O. 12898, I thought the index information has a higher likelihood of being current and accurate. As stated from the website, the EJ Indexes “combine demographic information with a single environmental indicator (such as proximity to traffic) that can help identify communities living in areas with greater potential for environmental and health impacts.” [United States Environmental Protection Agency Data](https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid={88D8AEA9-DF0A-448D-9041-1F71CC1AC4CE)

The link for the dataset is as follows:

I would like to use the data to create an informative and progressive presentation that will actually be useful in addressing environmental injustices. In terms of geographic location, I may start broad from a national, state-wide level and then focus into a specific area such as Allegheny County. The EPA has regional subunits that oversee individual states across multiple geographic regions in the US, so I could definitely manipulate that information to create an effective data visualization. Moreover, the overall scope of my project will be presenting how the various types of injustices such as water runoff, air pollution, lack of access to healthy foods etc. vary across marginalized groups, so I most likely will have to use multiple data files to capture all that information while simultaneously examining the racial aspect in one graph. 

## Method and Medium

I plan to build from the data using Shorthand due to its interactive features and the ease of creating an appealing project without having to worry about the technical nuances. I will use Flourish studio’s pre-constructed templates for the bulk of my actual graphics. If I decide to do a story map, I will use Tableau since I can overlap multiple data files into one project and create a multi-dimensional approach. Though my project deliverable will be documented digitally, the goal is to use the interactive features from these methods and mediums to invoke implementable and actionable changes to environmental injustices.
