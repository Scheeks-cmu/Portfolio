# Final Data Story

## Environmental (In)justice
*Caring for the environment -with cool people- in cool places.*

I feel as though my project has changed drastically since Part 2. Based on the feedback, I needed to redesign my data visualizations all together. In fact, 
as I compiled more information to build my story, I realized that there is so much opportunity for interesting and enticing visualizations based on the rich and dynamic topic. Although admittedly, I feel that those sophisticated visualizations may be without reach of my current abilities. My audience remained the same--communities of color in Pittsburgh. I think what changed the most for me was how I would go about strategically interacting with my audience. I also learned from Part 2 that there are actually people (and more specifically people of color) who are interested in learning more about environmental injustice as a whole, particularly with regard to Pittsburgh. I learned throughout the user research process and interviews that people best connected to personal anecdotes and familiar terms/areas/vernacular, so I tried to focus in on the city and highlight some of the well-known injusticed areas to convey familiartiy and as a result, develop better connections with my audience. What's more, the user feedback I received from Part 2 made the process of redesigning my data visualizations easier since I was able to make more intentional and direct changes that I knew would improve the overall appearance and understing of the charts/graphs, making for a more effective data story. 

My ultimate goal is to start a non-profit organization centered around environmental racism and I'm excited that I'll be able to utilize not only the final data story, but also the entire exploratative and research processes as foundational points within this vision of mine. Initially, I attempted to focus on the topic broadly to cover a wide range of environmental issues, but environmental racism is intersectional based on factors of  race, socioeconomic status, geographic location, etc.; thus, examining the different aspects that play a role in disparities (i.e. water pollution, toxic waste, energy poverty) when considering these intersectional factors make the process that much more broad and extensive. So with the help of feedback from my classmates and professor, I narrowed down my topic to focus on one challenge, Air Pollution. I felt that is fitting as well considering that Pittsburgh has and continues to have some of the highest rates of air pollution in the country, which I thought could make for a fun and interesting discussion as I seek to educate these local Pittsburgh residents. Although I decided to narrow my research down to one particular element of environmental inequities in Pittsburgh, I would like to expand this array to be more comprehensive and inclusive once my organization launches. All in all, I had fun with the project and learned a lot of great information that I fullly intend to use in the future-- for that I am thankful.
